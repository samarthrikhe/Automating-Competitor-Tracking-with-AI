# Automating-Competitor-Tracking-with-AI
Building a competitor intelligence system like this is a brilliant way to stay ahead of the curve.
Creating a comprehensive competitor intelligence system involves several key components:

GitHub Monitoring: Use APIs to track competitors' GitHub commits, analyzing commit frequency and patterns to gauge development speed.

Job Posting Tracking: Scrape job boards and company career pages to identify new job postings and analyze the roles being filled to understand strategic shifts.

App Review Analysis: Utilize sentiment analysis on app reviews to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement in competitors' products.

Pricing Page Scanning: Implement web scraping to monitor competitors' pricing pages for any changes in pricing strategies or positioning.

Data Synthesis: Use AI models like Claude to synthesize the collected data into daily briefs, summarizing key insights and trends.

Automation with n8n: Set up n8n workflows to automate the data collection and processing tasks, ensuring the system runs smoothly without manual intervention.

Dashboard Creation: Build a Notion dashboard to present the synthesized data in a user-friendly format, making it easy to digest and actionable.

Autopilot Functionality: Ensure that the entire system operates on autopilot, with scheduled tasks and alerts for significant changes or insights.
